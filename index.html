        During my first year of college, many moons ago, I took a coding
        class for one semester. Since then, my career and education have
        taken me many different directions. However, coding is very
        different from my one semester back in the last 90s. So, I am very
        excited to gain experience in developing new skills to become a
        great web developer like B.A.Cas!

        I grew up in the small town of Helper, Utah, where I attended what
        is now Utah State University Eastern. I grew up and moved on. I
        recently graduated from Washington State University with a master's.
        I thought, why not add to my collection of Universities I've
        attended.

        Besides going to school, I'm a busy mom of three, run a veterinary
        clinic, and serve in the schools and community. I'm the local
        Chamber of Commerce president, PTA Past President and Head Room
        Parent for my two boys classrooms.
